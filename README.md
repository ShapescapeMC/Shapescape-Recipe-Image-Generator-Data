# Recipe Image Generator Data

This is an example data repository for the [Recipe Image Generator](https://github.com/ShapescapeMC/Shapescape-Recipe-Image-Generator). You can read more about it in the [documentation](https://shapescape-recipe-image-generator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) of the project.

We cannot provide all of the resources needed for the generator to work. You should add them yourself to your local files [in your application data](https://shapescape-recipe-image-generator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/data_repositor):
- `RP` - this should contain a resource pack. You can use your custom resource pack or download vanilla RP from the official [Bedrock Samples](https://github.com/Mojang/bedrock-samples) repository.
- `block-images` - this should contain rendered block images that should look the same as in the inventory.
- `fonts` - If you are making custom templates that display text, you should add at least one `.ttf` font file so that the generator can use it.
